## Project Details ## 
The goal of this project is to create an intelligent system for recognizing human voice as source and predicting the corresponding alphabet through a mobile application using convolution neural network. 

## Voice Dataset ##
The Final Dataset for the voices. The voice dataset consist of 26 alphabet sounds, each alphabet consists of 20 different voice samples. total of 520 voice samples for 26 alphabets. The total sum of dataset collected from the whole group would be around 14K+ voices respectively.
